The Internet is the provides a sort of backbone for the Web, it basically sets up the infrastructure for the Web.
It is basically a way that large networks of computers and networks communicate with one another.
Without the internet, many people would not have a way to connect with other people's computers virtually.
The internet has changed in a lot of ways in the past 20 years and is still changing as of today.

When you click on a link to a certain website on the internet, there is a pocess that goes on to get you
to your destination. The first step that happens is the browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real
address of the server you are trying to connect to. Then, the browser sends an HTTP request message to the server,
asking it to send a copy of the website to your computer. If the server approves the request, the server sends a '200 OK'
message, which means you are allowed to look at the web page, and then starts sending a series of small chunks called data packets.
Finally, the browser assembles those small chunks into a complete website and displays it for you.
